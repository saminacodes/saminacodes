# Hi, I'm Samina! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I am a developer experience engineer at thirdweb, where I help create educational content and resources. I am passionate about education and helping others, so I create content to make tech education more accessible.

When I am not working, I am pretty introverted and like to unwind by playing video games, watching Korean dramas, drawing, cooking, or reading. I also have two goldfish and a black cat, Saia, who keep me company.


## 🛠 Skills
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Next... I did like two years of Java in college?
