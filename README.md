# Hi, I'm Samina! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I am a developer relations engineer at thirdweb. I primarily focus on helping developers
learn about web3 and how to build web3 apps. Sometimes I code fun little side projects (mostly frontend apps).
Outside of work, I am a huge fan of Marvel movies, play video games, and I like to draw.

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Next, Solidity... I did like two years of Java in college?
