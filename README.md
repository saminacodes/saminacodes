# Hi, I'm Samina! 👋

## 🚀 about me
I'm a product manager at [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com), and my main focus is our smart contracts library and tools. I'm also really passionate about education and helping others, so I sometimes create content to make tech education more accessible.

When I am not working, I am pretty introverted and like to unwind by playing video games, watching Korean dramas, drawing, learning piano, cooking, or reading. 

## 🛠 skills
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Next... I did like two years of Java in college?
